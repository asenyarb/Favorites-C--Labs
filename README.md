## Task: 
#### Write a function with a variable number of arguments of different types, which calculates the maximum among the arguments of the int type and located at odd places (numbering with 0). For example, the result of executing func(3, 2, 3.5, 4, 32, 'a', string("abc") ) will be an int type value equal to 4.
